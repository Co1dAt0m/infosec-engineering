# Contributing

I welcome suggestions for additions to this reading list; please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jacobian/infosec-engineering/issues) to suggest additions.

Note that I'm only including material that I've read personally (and found useful), so it might take some time until I get around to reading your suggestions (especially true of books).
